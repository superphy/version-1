	abstract = {Several pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli exploit type {III} secretion to inject "effector proteins" into human cells, which then subvert eukaryotic cell biology to the bacterium's advantage. We have exploited bioinformatics and experimental approaches to establish that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli ({EHEC)} {O157:H7} is much larger than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of {\textgreater}60 putative effector genes. Thirteen of these were judged to be likely pseudogenes, whereas 49 were judged to be potentially functional. In total, 39 proteins were confirmed experimentally as effectors: 31 through proteomics and 28 through translocation assays. At the protein level, the {EHEC} effector sequences fall into {\textgreater}20 families. The largest family, the {NleG} family, contains 14 members in the Sakai strain alone. {EHEC} also harbors functional homologs of effectors from plant pathogens ({HopPtoH}, {HopW}, {AvrA)} and from Shigella ({OspD}, {OspE}, {OspG)}, and two additional members of the {Map/IpgB} family. Genes encoding proven or predicted effectors occur in {\textgreater}20 exchangeable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Crucially, the majority of functional effector genes are encoded by nine exchangeable effector loci that lie within lambdoid prophages. Thus, type {III} secretion in E. coli is linked to a vast phage "metagenome," acting as a crucible for the evolution of pathogenicity.},

	abstract = {Subtilase cytotoxin ({SubAB)} from verotoxin ({VT)-producing} Escherichia coli ({VTEC)} strains was first described in the {98NK2} strain and has been associated with human disease. However, {SubAB} has recently been found in two {VT-negative} E. coli strains ({ED} 591 and {ED} 32). {SubAB} is encoded by two closely linked, cotranscribed genes ({subA} and {subB).} In this study, we investigated the presence of {subAB} genes in 52 {VTEC} strains isolated from cattle and 209 strains from small ruminants, using {PCR.} Most (91.9\%) {VTEC} strains from sheep and goats and 25\% of the strains from healthy cattle possessed {subAB} genes. The presence of {subAB} in a high percentage of the {VTEC} strains from small ruminants might increase the pathogenicity of these strains for human beings. Some differences in the results of {PCRs} and in the association with some virulence genes suggested the existence of different variants of {subAB.} We therefore sequenced the {subA} gene in 12 strains and showed that the {subA} gene in most of the {subAB-positive} {VTEC} strains from cattle was almost identical (about 99\%) to that in the {98NK2} strain, while the {subA} gene in most of the {subAB-positive} {VTEC} strains from small ruminants was almost identical to that in the {ED} 591 strain. We propose the terms {subAB1} to describe the {SubAB-coding} genes resembling that in the {98NK2} strain and {subAB2} to describe those resembling that in the {ED} 591 strain.},

It is the prototype of a new family of {AB(5)} toxins, comprising a single 35-kilodalton ({kD)} A subunit and a pentamer of 13-{kD} B subunits. The A subunit is a subtilase-like serine protease distantly related to the {BA\_2875} gene product of Bacillus anthracis. The B subunit is related to a putative exported protein from Yersinia pestis, and binds to a mimic of the ganglioside {GM2.} Subtilase cytotoxin is encoded by two closely linked, cotranscribed genes ({subA} and {subB)}, which, in strain {98NK2}, are located on a large, conjugative virulence plasmid. Homologues of the genes are present in 32 out of 68 other {STEC} strains tested. Intraperitoneal injection of purified subtilase cytotoxin was fatal for mice and resulted in extensive microvascular thrombosis, as well as necrosis in the brain, kidneys, and liver. Oral challenge of mice with E. coli K-12-expressing cloned {subA} and {subB} resulted in dramatic weight loss. These findings suggest that the toxin may contribute to the pathogenesis of human disease.},

	abstract = {Type {II} secretion systems ({T2SSs)} are critical for secretion of many proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. In the {T2SS}, the outer membrane secretin {GspD} forms a multimeric pore for translocation of secreted proteins. {GspD} and the inner membrane protein {GspC} interact with each other via periplasmic domains. Three different crystal structures of the homology region domain of {GspC} ({GspC(HR))} in complex with either two or three domains of the N-terminal region of {GspD} from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli show that {GspC(HR)} adopts an all-β topology. N-terminal β-strands of {GspC} and the N0 domain of {GspD} are major components of the interface between these inner and outer membrane proteins from the {T2SS.} The biological relevance of the observed {GspC-GspD} interface is shown by analysis of variant proteins in two-hybrid studies and by the effect of mutations in homologous genes on extracellular secretion and subcellular distribution of {GspC} in Vibrio cholerae. Substitutions of interface residues of {GspD} have a dramatic effect on the focal distribution of {GspC} in V. cholerae. These studies indicate that the {GspC(HR)-GspD(N0)} interactions observed in the crystal structure are essential for {T2SS} function. Possible implications of our structures for the stoichiometry of the {T2SS} and exoprotein secretion are discussed.},

	volume = {179},

	abstract = {The entire nucleotide sequence of the pil region of the {IncI1} plasmid R64 was determined. Analysis of the sequence indicated that 14 genes, designated {pilI} through {pilV}, are involved in the formation of the R64 thin pilus. Protein products of eight pil genes were identified by the maxicell procedure. The {pilN} product was shown to be a lipoprotein by an experiment using globomycin. A computer search revealed that several R64 pil genes have amino acid sequence homology with proteins involved in type {IV} pilus biogenesis, protein secretion, and transformation competence. The {pilS} and {pilV} products were suggested to be prepilins for the R64 thin pilus, and the {pilU} product appears to be a prepilin peptidase. These results suggest that the R64 thin pilus belongs to the type {IV} family, specifically group {IVB}, of pili. The requirement of the {pilR} and {pilU} genes for R64 liquid mating was demonstrated by constructing their frameshift mutations. Comparison of three type {IVB} pilus biogenesis systems, the pil system of R64, the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcp) system of Vibrio cholerae, and the bundle-forming pilus (bfp) system of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, suggests that they have evolved from a common ancestral gene system.},

The only factor clearly demonstrated to play a role in {EHEC} adherence to intestinal epithelial cells is intimin, which binds host cell integrins and nucleolin, as well as a receptor (Tir) that it injects into the host cell. Here we report that {EHEC} {O157:H7} produces adhesive type {IV} pili, which we term hemorrhagic coli pilus ({HCP)}, composed of a 19-{kDa} pilin subunit ({HcpA)} that is encoded by the {hcpA} chromosomal gene. {HCP} were observed as bundles of fibers greater than 10 microm in length that formed physical bridges between bacteria adhering to human and bovine host cells. Sera of {HUS} patients, but not healthy individuals, recognized {HcpA}, suggesting that the pili are produced in vivo during {EHEC} infections. Inactivation of the {hcpA} gene in {EHEC} {EDL933} resulted in significantly reduced adherence to cultured human intestinal and bovine renal epithelial cells and to porcine and bovine gut explants. An {escN} mutant, which is unable to translocate Tir, adhered less than the {hcpA} mutant, suggesting that adherence mediated by intimin-Tir interactions is a prelude to {HCP-mediated} adherence. An {hcpA} and stx1,2 triple mutant and an {hcpA} mutant had similar levels of adherence to bovine and human epithelial cells while a stx1,2 double mutant had only a minor defect in adherence, indicating that {HCP-mediated} adherence and cytotoxicity are independent events.

	abstract = {Systematic sequencing of the Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome ({GenBank} entry U18997) has revealed the presence of an apparently complete operon of genes (the {gspC-0} operon) similar to genes coding for components of the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway (e.g., the Klebsiella oxytoca {pulC-0} pullulanase secretion operon) and to related genes required for type {IV} pilus biogenesis. For example, the last gene in the gsp operon, {gspO} (formerly {hopD)}, encodes a protein which is similar to several type {IV} prepilin peptidases. Expression of {gspO} from {lacZp} promotes cleavage of two known prepilin peptidase substrates in E. coli K-12: Neisseria gonorrhoeae type {IV} prepilin and K. oxytoca {prePulG} protein. {gspO} also complements a mutation in the corresponding gene ({pulO)} of the pullulanase secretion operon when it is expressed from {lacZp.} Another gene in the gsp operon, {gspG} (formerly {hopG)}, encodes a protein similar to {prePulG}, a component of the pullulanase secretion pathway. Expression of {gspG} from {lacZp} leads to production of a protein which (i) is recognized by {PulG-specific} antiserum (and by antiserum against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa {PulG} homolog {XcpG} [formerly {XcpT])}, (ii) is processed in cells expressing {gspO}, and (iii) restores secretion in cells carrying a {pulG} mutation. The chromosomal copies of {gspG} and {gspO} are apparently not expressed, probably because of very weak transcription from the upstream region, as measured by using a chromosomal {gspC-lacZ} operon fusion. Thus, the gsp operon of E. coli K-12 includes at least two functional genes which, together with the rest of the operon, are probably not expressed under laboratory conditions.},

Processing of {prePulG} in Escherichia coli requires a glycine at position -1, as does processing by the cognate prepilin peptidase ({PulO)}, and is unaffected by mutations that inactivate several non-specific proteases. These data suggested that E. coli K-12 has a functional prepilin peptidase, despite the fact that it does not itself appear to express either type {IV} pilin or pseudopilin genes under the conditions that allow {prePilE} and {prePulG} processing. The E. coli K-12 genome contains two genes encoding proteins with significant sequence similarity to prepilin peptidases: {gspO} at minute 74.5 and {pppA} (f310c) at minute 67 on the genetic map. We have previously obtained evidence that {gspO} encodes an active enzyme but is not transcribed. {pppA} was cloned and shown to code for a functional prepilin peptidase capable of processing typical prepilin peptidase substrates. Inactivation of {pppA} eliminated the endogenous, thermoinducible prepilin peptidase activity. {PppA} was able to replace {PulO} prepilin peptidase in a pullulanase secretion system reconstituted in E. coli when expressed from high-copy-number plasmids but not when present in a single chromosomal copy. The analysis of {pppA-lacZ} fusions indicated that {pppA} expression was very low and regulated by the growth temperature at the level of translation, in agreement with the observed temperature dependence of {PppA} activity. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization analyses revealed the presence of the {pppA} gene in 12 out of 15 E. coli isolates.},

We identified a 4.1-Mb sequence highly conserved between the two strains, which may represent the fundamental backbone of the E. coli chromosome. The remaining 1.4-Mb sequence comprises of {O157:H7-specific} sequences, most of which are horizontally transferred foreign {DNAs.} The predominant roles of bacteriophages in the emergence of {O157:H7} is evident by the presence of 24 prophages and prophage-like elements that occupy more than half of the {O157:H7-specific} sequences.

	abstract = {The rapid emergence of Escherichia coli {O157:H7} from an unknown strain in 1982 to the dominant hemorrhagic E. coli serotype in the United States and the cause of widespread outbreaks of human food-borne illness highlights a need to evaluate critically the extent to which genomic plasticity of this important enteric pathogen contributes to its pathogenic potential and its evolution as well as its adaptation in different ecological niches. Aimed at a better understanding of the evolution of the E. coli {O157:H7} pathogenome, the present study presents the high-quality sequencing and comparative phylogenomic analysis of a comprehensive panel of 25 E. coli {O157:H7} strains associated with three nearly simultaneous food-borne outbreaks of human disease in the United States. Here we present a population genetic analysis of more than 200 related strains recovered from patients, contaminated produce, and zoonotic sources. High-resolution phylogenomic approaches allow the dynamics of pathogenome evolution to be followed at a high level of phylogenetic accuracy and resolution. {SNP} discovery and study of genome architecture and prophage content identified numerous biomarkers to assess the extent of genetic diversity within a set of clinical and environmental strains. A total of 1,225 {SNPs} were identified in the present study and are now available for typing of the E. coli {O157:H7} lineage. These data should prove useful for the development of a refined phylogenomic framework for forensic, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies to define better risk in response to novel and emerging E. coli {O157:H7} resistance and virulence phenotypes.},
