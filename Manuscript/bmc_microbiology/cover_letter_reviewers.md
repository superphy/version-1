Dear Editor,

Please find attached our manuscript, "SuperPhy: Predictive genomics for the bacterial pathogen _Escherichia coli_", by Matthew D Whiteside, Chad R Laing, Akiff Manji, Peter Kruczkiewicz, Eduardo N Taboada, and Victor PJ Gannon (MCRO-D-15-00461), which has been modified to take into account the suggestions from the reviewers.

We thank the reviewers for their time and input, as their suggestions have resulted in what we feel is an improved manuscript. We have included a detailed point-by-point response to each of the suggestions. Lastly, we have removed two Figures as we felt them to be redundant, and re-formatted others to make them easier to view.


Sincerely,

The Authors
