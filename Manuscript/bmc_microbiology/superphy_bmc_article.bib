	abstract = {{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{BACKGROUND}" {NlmCategory}="{BACKGROUND}"{\textgreater}The pan-genome of a bacterial species consists of a core and an accessory gene pool. The accessory genome is thought to be an important source of genetic variability in bacterial populations and is gained through lateral gene transfer, allowing subpopulations of bacteria to better adapt to specific niches. Low-cost and high-throughput sequencing platforms have created an exponential increase in genome sequence data and an opportunity to study the pan-genomes of many bacterial species. In this study, we describe a new online pan-genome sequence analysis program, Panseq.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}
{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{RESULTS}" {NlmCategory}="{RESULTS}"{\textgreater}Panseq was used to identify Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli K-12 genomic islands. Within a population of 60 E. coli O157:H7 strains, the existence of 65 accessory genomic regions identified by Panseq analysis was confirmed by {PCR}. The accessory genome and binary presence/absence data, and core genome and single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) of six L. monocytogenes strains were extracted with Panseq and hierarchically clustered and visualized. The nucleotide core and binary accessory data were also used to construct maximum parsimony ({MP}) trees, which were compared to the {MP} tree generated by multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST}). The topology of the accessory and core trees was identical but differed from the tree produced using seven {MLST} loci. The Loci Selector module found the most variable and discriminatory combinations of four loci within a 100 loci set among 10 strains in 1 s, compared to the 449 s required to exhaustively search for all possible combinations; it also found the most discriminatory 20 loci from a 96 loci E. coli O157:H7 {SNP} dataset.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}
{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{CONCLUSION}" {NlmCategory}="{CONCLUSIONS}"{\textgreater}Panseq determines the core and accessory regions among a collection of genomic sequences based on user-defined parameters. It readily extracts regions unique to a genome or group of genomes, identifies {SNPs} within shared core genomic regions, constructs files for use in phylogeny programs based on both the presence/absence of accessory regions and {SNPs} within core regions and produces a graphical overview of the output. Panseq also includes a loci selector that calculates the most variable and discriminatory loci among sets of accessory loci or core gene {SNPs}.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}

	abstract = {Motivation: Phylogenetic tree-building methods use molecular data to represent the evolutionary history of genes and taxa. A recurrent problem is to reconcile the various phylogenies built from different genomic sequences into a single one. This task is generally conducted by a two-step approach whereby a binary representation of the initial trees is first inferred and then a maximum parsimony ({MP}) analysis is performed on it. This binary representation uses a decomposition of all source trees that is usually based on clades, but that can also be based on triplets or quartets. The relative performances of these representations have been discussed but are difficult to assess since both are limited to relatively small datasets.
Results: This article focuses on the triplet-based representation of source trees. We first recall how, using this representation, the parsimony analysis is related to the median tree notion. We then introduce {SuperTriplets}, a new algorithm that is specially designed to optimize this alternative formulation of the {MP} criterion. The method avoids several practical limitations of the triplet-based binary matrix representation, making it useful to deal with large datasets. When the correct resolution of every triplet appears more often than the incorrect ones in source trees, {SuperTriplets} warrants to reconstruct the correct phylogeny. Both simulations and a case study on mammalian phylogenomics confirm the advantages of this approach. In both cases, {SuperTriplets} tends to propose less resolved but more reliable supertrees than those inferred using Matrix Representation with Parsimony.

Despite the fact that the first genomes sequenced of free living organisms were those of bacteria, there have been few specialized bioinformatic tools developed to mine the growing amount of genomic data associated with pathogens. In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database ({CARD}; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The {CARD} integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology ({ARO}), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences. This unique platform provides an informatic tool that bridges antibiotic resistance concerns in health care, agriculture, and the environment.},

We recently sequenced the genomes of 601 type emm59 Group A Streptococcus ({GAS}) organisms responsible for an ongoing epidemic of invasive infections in Canada and some of the United States. The epidemic has been caused by the emergence of a genetically distinct, hypervirulent clone that has genetically diversified. The ease of obtaining genomic data contrasts with the relatively difficult task of translating them into insightful epidemiological information. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 90 additional invasive Canadian emm59 {GAS} organisms, including 80 isolated recently in 2010–2011. We used an improved bioinformatics pipeline designed to rapidly process and analyze whole-genome data and integrate strain metadata. We discovered that emm59 {GAS} organisms are undergoing continued multiclonal evolutionary expansion. Previously identified geographic patterns of strain dissemination are being diluted as mixing of subclones over time and space occurs. Our integrated data analysis strategy permits prompt and accurate mapping of the dissemination of bacterial organisms in an epidemic wave, permitting rapid generation of hypotheses that inform public health and virulence studies.},

Rapid bacterial whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) is an emerging technology that has the potential to rapidly discriminate outbreak from non-outbreak isolates in a clinically relevant time frame.
Methods We performed a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using bacterial {WGS} to differentiate outbreak from non-outbreak isolates collected during an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease. Seven Legionella isolates (three clinical and four environmental) were obtained from the reference laboratory and sequenced using the Illumina {MiSeq} platform at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Bioinformatic analysis was performed blinded to the epidemiological data at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
Results We were able to distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak isolates using bacterial {WGS}, and to confirm the probable environmental source. Our analysis also highlighted constraints, which were the small number of Legionella pneumophila isolates available for sequencing, and the limited number of published genomes for comparison.
Conclusions We have demonstrated the feasibility of using rapid {WGS} to investigate an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease. Future work includes building larger genomic databases of L pneumophila from both clinical and environmental sources, developing automated data interpretation software, and conducting a cost–benefit analysis of {WGS} versus current typing methods.},

	abstract = {Objectives Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates is essential for clinical diagnosis, to detect emerging problems and to guide empirical treatment. Current phenotypic procedures are sometimes associated with mistakes and may require further genetic testing. Whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) may soon be within reach even for routine surveillance and clinical diagnostics. The aim of this study was to evaluate {WGS} as a routine tool for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance compared with current phenotypic procedures.
Methods Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on 200 isolates originating from Danish pigs, covering four bacterial species. Genomic {DNA} was purified from all isolates and sequenced as paired-end reads on the Illumina platform. The web servers {ResFinder} and {MLST} (www.genomicepidemiology.org) were used to identify acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and {MLST} types (where {MLST} stands for multilocus sequence typing). {ResFinder} results were compared with phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing results using {EUCAST} epidemiological cut-off values and {MLST} types.
Results A total of 3051 different phenotypic tests were performed; 482 led to the categorizing of isolates as resistant and 2569 as susceptible. Seven cases of disagreement between tested and predicted susceptibility were observed, six of which were related to spectinomycin resistance in Escherichia coli. Correlation between {MLST} type and resistance profiles was only observed in Salmonella Typhimurium, where isolates belonging to sequence type ({ST}) 34 were more resistant than {ST}19 isolates.
Conclusions High concordance (99.74\%) between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibility was observed. Thus, antimicrobial resistance testing based on {WGS} is an alternative to conventional phenotypic methods.},

	abstract = {Sequence-based typing is essential for understanding the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection, a major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis world-wide. We demonstrate the practical and rapid exploitation of whole genome sequencing to provide routine definitive characterisation of C. jejuni and C. coli for clinical and public health purposes. Short-read data from 384 Campylobacter clinical isolates collected over four months in Oxford, United Kingdom, were assembled de novo. Contigs were deposited on the {pubMLST}.org/campylobacter website and automatically annotated for 1667 loci. Typing and phylogenetic information were extracted and comparative analyses performed for various subsets of loci, up to the level of whole genome, using Genome Comparator and {NeighborNet} algorithms. The assembled sequences (for 379 isolates) were diverse, and resembled collections from previous studies of human campylobacteriosis. Small subsets of very closely related isolates mainly originated from repeated same patient samples, and in one case, a likely laboratory contamination. Much of the within patient variation occurred in phase variable genes. Clinically and epidemiologically informative data can be extracted from {WGS} data in real time with straightforward, publicly available tools. These analyses are highly scalable, transparent, do not require closely related genome reference sequences, and provide improved resolution: (i) among Campylobacter clonal complexes; and, (ii) between very closely related isolates. Additionally, these analyses rapidly differentiated unrelated isolates, allowing the detection of single strain clusters. The approach is widely applicable to human bacterial pathogens in real time in clinical laboratories with little specialist training required.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) of bacterial genomes has recently become more accessible and is now available to the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory. However, questions remain regarding its feasibility, particularly with respect to data analysis in nonspecialist centers. To test the applicability of {NGS} to outbreak investigations, Ion Torrent sequencing was used to investigate a putative multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli outbreak in the neonatal unit of the Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, Australia. Four suspected outbreak strains and a comparator strain were sequenced. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) analysis demonstrated that the four neonatal intensive care unit ({NICU}) strains were identical and easily differentiated from the comparator strain. Genome sequence data also determined that the {NICU} strains belonged to multilocus sequence type 131 and carried the {blaCTX}-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Comparison of the outbreak strains to all publicly available complete E. coli genome sequences showed that they clustered with neonatal meningitis and uropathogenic isolates. The turnaround time from a positive culture to the completion of sequencing (prior to data analysis) was 5 days, and the cost was approximately \$300 per strain (for the reagents only). The main obstacles to a mainstream adoption of {NGS} technologies in diagnostic microbiology laboratories are currently cost (although this is decreasing), a paucity of user-friendly and clinically focused bioinformatics platforms, and a lack of genomics expertise outside the research environment. Despite these hurdles, {NGS} technologies provide unparalleled high-resolution genotyping in a short time frame and are likely to be widely implemented in the field of diagnostic microbiology in the next few years, particularly for epidemiological investigations (replacing current typing methods) and the characterization of resistance determinants. Clinical microbiologists need to familiarize themselves with these technologies and their applications.},

	url = {http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/13/i337},
	abstract = {Motivation: A few years ago, {FlyBase} undertook to design a new database schema to store Drosophila data. It would fully integrate genomic sequence and annotation data with bibliographic, genetic, phenotypic and molecular data from the literature representing a distillation of the first 100 years of research on this major animal model system. In developing this new integrated schema, {FlyBase} also made a commitment to ensure that its design was generic, extensible and available as open source, so that it could be employed as the core schema of any model organism data repository, thereby avoiding redundant software development and potentially increasing interoperability. Our question was whether we could create a relational database schema that would be successfully reused.
Results: Chado is a relational database schema now being used to manage biological knowledge for a wide variety of organisms, from human to pathogens, especially the classes of information that directly or indirectly can be associated with genome sequences or the primary {RNA} and protein products encoded by a genome. Biological databases that conform to this schema can interoperate with one another, and with application software from the Generic Model Organism Database ({GMOD}) toolkit. Chado is distinctive because its design is driven by ontologies. The use of ontologies (or controlled vocabularies) is ubiquitous across the schema, as they are used as a means of typing entities. The Chado schema is partitioned into integrated subschemas (modules), each encapsulating a different biological domain, and each described using representations in appropriate ontologies. To illustrate this methodology, we describe here the Chado modules used for describing genomic sequences.

	abstract = {Background
We recently described {FastTree}, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to {FastTree} that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Where {FastTree} 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges ({NNIs}) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, {FastTree} 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting ({SPRs}) and maximum-likelihood {NNIs}. {FastTree} 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “{CAT}” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, {FastTree} 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood {NNIs} ({PhyML} 3 with default settings). Although {FastTree} 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood {SPRs}, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, {FastTree} 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. {FastTree} 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal {RNAs} on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

Conclusions/Significance
{FastTree} 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. {FastTree} 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

	abstract = {Summary: Clearcut is an open source implementation for the relaxed neighbor joining ({RNJ}) algorithm. While traditional neighbor joining ({NJ}) remains a popular method for distance-based phylogenetic tree reconstruction, it suffers from a O(N3) time complexity, where N represents the number of taxa in the input. Due to this steep asymptotic time complexity, {NJ} cannot reasonably handle very large datasets. In contrast, {RNJ} realizes a typical-case time complexity on the order of N2logN without any significant qualitative difference in output. {RNJ} is particularly useful when inferring a very large tree or a large number of trees. In addition, {RNJ} retains the desirable property that it will always reconstruct the true tree given a matrix of additive pairwise distances. Clearcut implements {RNJ} as a C program, which takes either a set of aligned sequences or a pre-computed distance matrix as input and produces a phylogenetic tree. Alternatively, Clearcut can reconstruct phylogenies using an extremely fast standard {NJ} implementation.

	abstract = {Multiple sequencing of genomes belonging to a bacterial species allows one to analyze and compare statistics and dynamics of the gene complements of species, their pan-genomes. Here, we analyzed multiple genomes of Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella enterica. We demonstrate that the distribution of the number of genomes harboring a gene is well approximated by a sum of two power functions, describing frequent genes (present in many strains) and rare genes (present in few strains). The virtual absence of Shigella-specific genes not present in E. coli genomes confirms previous observations that Shigella is not an independent genus. While the pan-genome size is increasing with each new strain, the number of genes present in a fixed fraction of strains stabilizes quickly. For instance, slightly fewer than 4,000 genes are present in at least half of any group of E. coli genomes. Comparison of S. enterica and E. coli pan-genomes revealed the existence of a common periphery, that is, genes present in some but not all strains of both species. Analysis of phylogenetic trees demonstrates that rare genes from the periphery likely evolve under horizontal transfer, whereas frequent periphery genes may have been inherited from the periphery genome of the common ancestor.},

Sixty-one publically available E. coli and Shigella spp. sequenced genomes are compared, using basic methods to produce phylogenetic and proteomics trees, and to identify the pan- and core genomes of this set of sequenced strains. A hierarchical clustering of variable genes allowed clear separation of the strains into clusters, including known pathotypes; clinically relevant serotypes can also be resolved in this way. In contrast, when in silico {MLST} was performed, many of the various strains appear jumbled and less well resolved. The predicted pan-genome comprises 15,741 gene families, and only 993 (6\%) of the families are represented in every genome, comprising the core genome. The variable or 'accessory' genes thus make up more than 90\% of the pan-genome and about 80\% of a typical genome; some of these variable genes tend to be co-localized on genomic islands. The diversity within the species E. coli, and the overlap in gene content between this and related species, suggests a continuum rather than sharp species borders in this group of Enterobacteriaceae.},

Multiple correspondence analyses using data obtained from the four esterases and the 11 other enzymes also distinguished the groups A, B1, B2, C, D and E.

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The emergence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}) that can persist in the community and replace existing hospital-adapted lineages of {MRSA} means that it is necessary to understand transmission dynamics in terms of hospitals and the community as one entity. We assessed the use of whole-genome sequencing to enhance detection of {MRSA} transmission between these settings.
Methods
We studied a putative {MRSA} outbreak on a special care baby unit ({SCBU}) at a National Health Service Foundation Trust in Cambridge, {UK}. We used whole-genome sequencing to validate and expand findings from an infection-control team who assessed the outbreak through conventional analysis of epidemiological data and antibiogram profiles. We sequenced isolates from all colonised patients in the {SCBU}, and sequenced {MRSA} isolates from patients in the hospital or community with the same antibiotic susceptibility profile as the outbreak strain.
Findings
The hospital infection-control team identified 12 infants colonised with {MRSA} in a 6 month period in 2011, who were suspected of being linked, but a persistent outbreak could not be confirmed with conventional methods. With whole-genome sequencing, we identified 26 related cases of {MRSA} carriage, and showed transmission occurred within the {SCBU}, between mothers on a postnatal ward, and in the community. The outbreak {MRSA} type was a new sequence type ({ST}) 2371, which is closely related to {ST}22, but contains genes encoding Panton-Valentine leucocidin. Whole-genome sequencing data were used to propose and confirm that {MRSA} carriage by a staff member had allowed the outbreak to persist during periods without known infection on the {SCBU} and after a deep clean.
Interpretation
Whole-genome sequencing holds great promise for rapid, accurate, and comprehensive identification of bacterial transmission pathways in hospital and community settings, with concomitant reductions in infections, morbidity, and costs.

We combined conventional molecular methods and whole genome sequence ({WGS}) analysis to investigate an outbreak of L. pneumophila in a large Australian hospital. Typing of these isolates using sequence-based typing and virulence gene profiling, was unable to discriminate between outbreak and non-outbreak isolates. {WGS} analysis was performed on isolates during the outbreak, as well as on unlinked isolates from the Public Health Microbiology reference collection. The more powerful resolution provided by analysis of whole genome sequences allowed outbreak isolates to be distinguished from isolates that were temporally and spatially unassociated with the outbreak, demonstrating that this technology can be used in real-time to investigate L. pneumophila outbreaks.},

	abstract = {We sequenced the genomes of 3,615 strains of serotype Emm protein 1 (M1) group A Streptococcus to unravel the nature and timing of molecular events contributing to the emergence, dissemination, and genetic diversification of an unusually virulent clone that now causes epidemic human infections worldwide. We discovered that the contemporary epidemic clone emerged in stepwise fashion from a precursor cell that first contained the phage encoding an extracellular {DNase} virulence factor (streptococcal {DNase} D2, {SdaD}2) and subsequently acquired the phage encoding the {SpeA}1 variant of the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A superantigen. The {SpeA}2 toxin variant evolved from {SpeA}1 by a single-nucleotide change in the M1 progenitor strain before acquisition by horizontal gene transfer of a large chromosomal region encoding secreted toxins {NAD}+-glycohydrolase and streptolysin O. Acquisition of this 36-kb region in the early 1980s into just one cell containing the phage-encoded {sdaD}2 and {speA}2 genes was the final major molecular event preceding the emergence and rapid intercontinental spread of the contemporary epidemic clone. Thus, we resolve a decades-old controversy about the type and sequence of genomic alterations that produced this explosive epidemic. Analysis of comprehensive, population-based contemporary invasive strains from seven countries identified strong patterns of temporal population structure. Compared with a preepidemic reference strain, the contemporary clone is significantly more virulent in nonhuman primate models of pharyngitis and necrotizing fasciitis. A key finding is that the molecular evolutionary events transpiring in just one bacterial cell ultimately have produced millions of human infections worldwide.},

	abstract = {Closely related bacterial genomes usually differ in gene content, suggesting that nearly every strain in nature may be ecologically unique. We have tested this hypothesis by sequencing the genomes of extremely close relatives within a recognized taxon, and analyzing the genomes for evidence of ecological distinctness. We compared the genomes of four Death Valley isolates plus the laboratory strain W23, all previously classified to Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii and hypothesized through multilocus analysis to be members of the same ecotype (an ecologically homogeneous population), named Putative Ecotype 15 ({PE}15). These strains showed a history of positive selection on amino acid sequences in 38 genes. Each of the strains was under a different regimen of positive selection, suggesting that each strain is ecologically unique and represents a distinct ecological speciation event. The rate of speciation appears to be much faster than can be resolved with multilocus sequencing. Each {PE}15 strain contained unique genes known to confer a function for bacteria. Remarkably, no unique gene conferred a metabolic system or subsystem function that was not already present in all the {PE}15 strains sampled. Thus, the origin of ecotypes within this clade shows no evidence of qualitative divergence in the set of resources utilized. Ecotype formation within this clade is consistent with the Nano-Niche model of bacterial speciation, where ecotypes use the same set of resources but in different proportions, and genetic cohesion extends beyond a single ecotype to the set of ecotypes utilizing the same resources.},

The analyses of these data have implications for all levels of clinical and public health practice, from institutional infection control to policies for surveillance, prevention and treatment.

Enterohemorrhagic E. coli ({EHEC}) are often identified as isolates that are {LEE}+ and carry the Shiga toxin (stx)-encoding phage, which are labeled Shiga toxin-producing E. coli; whereas enteropathogenic E. coli ({EPEC}) are {LEE}+ and often carry the {EPEC} adherence factor plasmid-encoded bundle-forming pilus (bfp) genes. All other {LEE}+/bfp−/stx− isolates have been historically designated atypical {EPEC}. These groups have been defined based on the presence or absence of a limited number of virulence factors, many of which are encoded on mobile elements. This study describes the comparative analysis of the genomes of 114 {LEE}+ E. coli isolates. Based on a whole-genome phylogeny and analysis of type {III} secretion system effectors, the {AEEC} are divided into five distinct genomic lineages. The {LEE}+/stx+/bfp− genomes were primarily divided into two genomic lineages, the O157/O55 {EHEC}1 and non-O157 {EHEC}2. The {LEE}+/bfp+/stx− {AEEC} isolates sequenced in this study separated into the {EPEC}1, {EPEC}2, and {EPEC}4 genomic lineages. A multiplex {PCR} assay for identification of each of these {AEEC} genomic lineages was developed. Of the 114 {AEEC} genomes analyzed, 31 {LEE}+ isolates were not in any of the known {AEEC} lineages and thus represent unclassified {AEEC} that in most cases are more similar to other E. coli pathovars than to text modification {AEEC}. Our findings demonstrate evolutionary relationships among diverse {AEEC} pathogens and the utility of phylogenomics for lineage-specific identification of {AEEC} clinical isolates.},

Pathogenic variants of E. coli (pathovars or pathotypes) cause much morbidity and mortality worldwide. Consequently, pathogenic E. coli is widely studied in humans, animals, food, and the environment. While there are many common features that these pathotypes employ to colonize the intestinal mucosa and cause disease, the course, onset, and complications vary significantly. Outbreaks are common in developed and developing countries, and they sometimes have fatal consequences. Many of these pathotypes are a major public health concern as they have low infectious doses and are transmitted through ubiquitous mediums, including food and water. The seriousness of pathogenic E. coli is exemplified by dedicated national and international surveillance programs that monitor and track outbreaks; unfortunately, this surveillance is often lacking in developing countries. While not all pathotypes carry the same public health profile, they all carry an enormous potential to cause disease and continue to present challenges to human health.

Subsequently, numerous {STEC} strains have been characterized that express toxins with variations in amino acid sequence, some of which confer unique biological properties. These variants were grouped within the Stx1 or Stx2 type and often assigned names to indicate that they were not identical in sequence or phenotype to the main Stx1 or Stx2 type. A lack of specificity or consistency in toxin nomenclature has led to much confusion in the characterization of {STEC} strains. Because serious outcomes of infection have been attributed to certain Stx subtypes and less so with others, we sought to better define the toxin subtypes within the main Stx1 and Stx2 types. We compared the levels of relatedness of 285 valid sequence variants of Stx1 and Stx2 and identified common sequences characteristic of each of three Stx/Stx1 and seven Stx2 subtypes. A novel, simple {PCR} subtyping method was developed, independently tested on a battery of 48 prototypic {STEC} strains, and improved at six clinical and research centers to test the reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of the {PCR}. Using a consistent schema for nomenclature of the Stx toxins and stx genes by phylogenetic sequence-based relatedness of the holotoxin proteins, we developed a typing approach that should obviate the need to bioassay each newly described toxin and that predicts important biological characteristics.},

	abstract = {The {BLAST} programs are widely used tools for searching protein and {DNA} databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated {BLAST} ({PSI}-{BLAST}) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI}-{BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

Studies have demonstrated that individuals with an ileal neobladder have recurrent colonization by Escherichia coli and other species that are commonly associated with urinary tract infections; however, pyelonephritis and complicated symptomatic infections with ileal neobladders are relatively rare. This study examines the genomic content of two E. coli isolates from individuals with neobladders using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) with a pan-E. coli/Shigella microarray. Comparisons of the neobladder genome hybridization patterns with reference genomes demonstrate that the neobladder isolates are more similar to the commensal, laboratory-adapted E. coli and a subset of enteroaggregative E. coli than they are to uropathogenic E. coli isolates. Genes identified by CGH as exclusively present in the neobladder isolates among the 30 examined isolates were primarily from large enteric isolate plasmids. Isolations identified a large plasmid in each isolate, and sequencing confirmed similarity to previously identified plasmids of enteric species. Screening, via PCR, of more than 100 isolates of E. coli from environmental, diarrhoeagenic and urinary tract sources did not identify neobladder-specific genes that were widely distributed in these populations. These results taken together demonstrate that the neobladder isolates, while distinct, are genomically more similar to gastrointestinal or commensal E. coli, suggesting why they can colonize the transplanted intestinal tissue but rarely progress to acute pyelonephritis or more severe disease.},

Public health microbiology is currently being transformed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which opens the door to serotype determination using WGS data. SeqSero (www.denglab.info/SeqSero) is a novel Web-based tool for determining Salmonella serotypes using high-throughput genome sequencing data. SeqSero is based on curated databases of Salmonella serotype determinants (rfb gene cluster, fliC and fljB alleles) and is predicted to determine serotype rapidly and accurately for nearly the full spectrum of Salmonella serotypes (more than 2,300 serotypes), from both raw sequencing reads and genome assemblies. The performance of SeqSero was evaluated by testing (i) raw reads from genomes of 308 Salmonella isolates of known serotype; (ii) raw reads from genomes of 3,306 Salmonella isolates sequenced and made publicly available by GenomeTrakr, a U.S. national monitoring network operated by the Food and Drug Administration; and (iii) 354 other publicly available draft or complete Salmonella genomes. We also demonstrated Salmonella serotype determination from raw sequencing reads of fecal metagenomes from mice orally infected with this pathogen. SeqSero can help to maintain the well-established utility of Salmonella serotyping when integrated into a platform of WGS-based pathogen subtyping and characterization.},

The current routine procedure is based on a variety of techniques, making the procedure laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. With whole-genome sequencing (WGS) becoming cheaper, it has huge potential in both diagnostics and routine surveillance. The aim of this study was to perform a real-time evaluation of WGS for routine typing and surveillance of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). In Denmark, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) routinely receives all suspected VTEC isolates. During a 7-week period in the fall of 2012, all incoming isolates were concurrently subjected to WGS using IonTorrent PGM. Real-time bioinformatics analysis was performed using web-tools (www.genomicepidemiology.org) for species determination, multilocus sequence type (MLST) typing, and determination of phylogenetic relationship, and a specific VirulenceFinder for detection of E. coli virulence genes was developed as part of this study. In total, 46 suspected VTEC isolates were characterized in parallel during the study. VirulenceFinder proved successful in detecting virulence genes included in routine typing, explicitly verocytotoxin 1 (vtx1), verocytotoxin 2 (vtx2), and intimin (eae), and also detected additional virulence genes. VirulenceFinder is also a robust method for assigning verocytotoxin (vtx) subtypes. A real-time clustering of isolates in agreement with the epidemiology was established from WGS, enabling discrimination between sporadic and outbreak isolates. Overall, WGS typing produced results faster and at a lower cost than the current routine. Therefore, WGS typing is a superior alternative to conventional typing strategies. This approach may also be applied to typing and surveillance of other pathogens.},

Stakeholder engagement is widely lauded as an important methodology for improving clinical, scientific, and public health policy decision making. The purpose of this paper is to examine how stakeholder engagement is used to develop policies in genomics research and public health areas, as well as to identify future priorities for conducting evidence-based stakeholder engagements. We focus on exemplars in biobanking and newborn screening to illustrate a variety of current stakeholder engagement in policy-making efforts. Each setting provides an important context for examining the methods of obtaining and integrating informed stakeholder voices into the policy-making process. While many organizations have an interest in engaging stakeholders with regard to genomic policy issues, there is broad divergence with respect to the stakeholders involved, the purpose of engagements, when stakeholders are engaged during policy development, methods of engagement, and the outcomes reported. Stakeholder engagement in genomics policy development is still at a nascent stage. Several challenges of using stakeholder engagement as a tool for genomics policy development remain, and little evidence regarding how to best incorporate stakeholder feedback into policy-making processes is currently available.

	abstract = {Author SummaryWhole genome sequencing (WGS) offers the potential for unprecedented insight into infectious diseases spread at the individual-to-individual level. However, this potential can be compromised when a poorly sampled ‘reservoir’ population contributes to transmission, as strong biases in the obtained data are inevitable. Therefore WGS data must be corroborated with epidemiological data in well-described systems, in order to enhance our confidence in their broader use. The epidemic of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in British and Irish cattle has both economic and animal health importance; it also involves a management host (the cattle) whose demographic history is exceptionally well-documented, and with a reservoir host (the badgers) whose role in bTB spread has defied decades of study and observation. Here, we show that the observed spatial patterns provide a good match to M. bovis WGS data, but cattle movement networks and within-herd transmission patterns generated by mathematical models do not. Thus WGS offers considerable promise for revealing basic principles about bTB maintenance in British cattle and the role of badgers, as well as suggesting that similar approaches combining mathematical models and WGS data could be useful for the study of human TB and other infectious diseases where sampling biases are known to exist.},

One emerging disease is bacterial canker of kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa and A. chinensis) caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (PSA). The disease first occurred in China and Japan in the 1980s and in Korea and Italy in the 1990s. A more severe form of the disease broke out in Italy in 2008 and in additional countries in 2010 and 2011 threatening the viability of the global kiwi fruit industry. To start investigating the source and routes of international transmission of PSA, genomes of strains from China (the country of origin of the genus Actinidia), Japan, Korea, Italy and Portugal have been sequenced. Strains from China, Italy, and Portugal have been found to belong to the same clonal lineage with only 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3,453,192 bp and one genomic island distinguishing the Chinese strains from the European strains. Not more than two SNPs distinguish each of the Italian and Portuguese strains from each other. The Japanese and Korean strains belong to a separate genetic lineage as previously reported. Analysis of additional European isolates and of New Zealand isolates exploiting genome-derived markers showed that these strains belong to the same lineage as the Italian and Chinese strains. Interestingly, the analyzed New Zealand strains are identical to European strains at the tested SNP loci but test positive for the genomic island present in the sequenced Chinese strains and negative for the genomic island present in the European strains. Results are interpreted in regard to the possible direction of movement of the pathogen between countries and suggest a possible Chinese origin of the European and New Zealand outbreaks.},

Its presence in such products has been associated with the formation of buttery and sour off-odors. Nevertheless, the spoilage potential of L. piscium varies dramatically depending on the strain and growth conditions. Additional knowledge about the genome is required to explain such variation, understand its phylogeny, and study gene functions. Here, we present the complete and annotated genomic sequence of L. piscium MKFS47, combined with a time course analysis of the glucose catabolism-based transcriptome. In addition, a comparative analysis of gene contents was done for L. piscium MKFS47 and 29 other lactococci, revealing three distinct clades within the genus. The genome of L. piscium MKFS47 consists of one chromosome, carrying 2,289 genes, and two plasmids. A wide range of carbohydrates was predicted to be fermented, and growth on glycerol was observed. Both carbohydrate and glycerol catabolic pathways were significantly upregulated in the course of time as a result of glucose exhaustion. At the same time, differential expression of the pyruvate utilization pathways, implicated in the formation of spoilage substances, switched the metabolism toward a heterofermentative mode. In agreement with data from previous inoculation studies, L. piscium MKFS47 was identified as an efficient producer of buttery-odor compounds under aerobic conditions. Finally, genes and pathways that may contribute to increased survival in meat environments were considered.},

Molecular tools such as WGS are being refined and advanced at a rapid pace to provide robust and higher-resolution methods for identifying, comparing, and classifying pathogenic organisms. If these methods of pathogen characterization are properly applied, they will enable an improved public health response whether a disease outbreak was initiated by natural events or by accidental or deliberate human activity.

	abstract = {An ongoing outbreak of exceptionally virulent Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 centered in Germany, has caused over 830 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and 46 deaths since May 2011. Serotype O104:H4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with HUS in the past. To prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the Life Technologies Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencer and Optical Mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (LB226692) and a historic O104:H4 HUS isolate from 2001 (01-09591). Reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced PGM™ within 62 hours. The HUS-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core E. coli genes indicate that the HUS-causing O104:H4 strains and the previously published sequence of the EAEC strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common EHEC serotypes. Though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. We propose a model in which EAEC 55989 and EHEC O104:H4 strains evolved from a common EHEC O104:H4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of EAEC and EHEC emerged as the current outbreak clone. In conclusion, rapid next-generation technologies facilitated prospective whole genome characterization in the early stages of an outbreak.},

	abstract = {Shigellae cause significant diarrheal disease and mortality in humans, as there are approximately 163 million episodes of shigellosis and 1.1 million deaths annually. While significant strides have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, few studies on the genomic content of the Shigella species have been completed. The goal of this study was to characterize the genomic diversity of Shigella species through sequencing of 55 isolates representing members of each of the four Shigella species: S. flexneri, S. sonnei, S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae. Phylogeny inferred from 336 available Shigella and Escherichia coli genomes defined exclusive clades of Shigella; conserved genomic markers that can identify each clade were then identified. PCR assays were developed for each clade-specific marker, which was combined with an amplicon for the conserved Shigella invasion antigen, IpaH3, into a multiplex PCR assay. This assay demonstrated high specificity, correctly identifying 218 of 221 presumptive Shigella isolates, and sensitivity, by not identifying any of 151 diverse E. coli isolates incorrectly as Shigella. This new phylogenomics-based PCR assay represents a valuable tool for rapid typing of uncharacterized Shigella isolates and provides a framework that can be utilized for the identification of novel genomic markers from genomic data.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary relationships of 46 Shigella strains representing each of the serotypes belonging to the four traditional Shigella species (subgroups), Dysenteriae, Flexneri, Boydii, and Sonnei, were determined by sequencing of eight housekeeping genes in four regions of the chromosome. Analysis revealed a very similar evolutionary pattern for each region. Three clusters of strains were identified, each including strains from different subgroups. Cluster 1 contains the majority of Boydii and Dysenteriae strains (B1-4, B6, B8, B10, B14, and B18; and D3-7, D9, and D11-13) plus Flexneri 6 and 6A. Cluster 2 contains seven Boydii strains (B5, B7, B9, B11, B15, B16, and B17) and Dysenteriae 2. Cluster 3 contains one Boydii strain (B12) and the Flexneri serotypes 1-5 strains. Sonnei and three Dysenteriae strains (D1, D8, and D10) are outside of the three main clusters but, nonetheless, are clearly within Escherichia coli. Boydii 13 was found to be distantly related to E. coli. Shigella strains, like the other pathogenic forms of E. coli, do not have a single evolutionary origin, indicating convergent evolution of Shigella phenotypic properties. We estimate the three main Shigella clusters to have evolved within the last 35,000 to 270,000 years, suggesting that shigellosis was one of the early infectious diseases of humans.},
