Dear Editor,

Please find attached the manuscript, "SuperPhy: Predictive genomics for the bacterial pathogen _Escherichia coli_", by Matthew D Whiteside, Chad R Laing, Akiff Manji, Peter Kruczkiewicz, Eduardo N Taboada, and Victor PJ Gannon. We believe it aligns well with the aims of Genome Biology to serve the biological research community in the rapidly changing landscape of genomics and software for performing genomic studies. 

We describe an online software platform for "predictive genomics" of _Escherichia coli_, that provides pre-computed genomic analyses and phenotypic metadata, and allows users to perform phylogenetic comparisons, geospatial analyses, analysis of virulence factors and anti-microbial resistance genes, and to identify group-specific genomic markers based on the presence / absence of genomic regions, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The platform therefore  fits well with the stated areas that Genome Biology covers such as new methods and software tools, bioinformatics, population genomics, evolution, and applications to molecular biology. The platform is dynamic, continuously updated from public data in GenBank, and allows users to upload their own genomes under both public and private data-sharing settings. 

Further, all aspects of the platform, manuscript and data are fully open access and hosted on a publicly accessible GitHub account. Thank you for taking the time to consider our manuscript, and we look forward to your evaluation.

Sincerely,

The Authors
